There was already a negative reception to it anyway, but it turns out that there’s much more that happens in this chapter, especially with Luffy versus Kaidou. Not only about Raizo, so let’s get into it. The title of the chapter is Raizo, we already saw that Raizo used his scroll to save Kaidou’s attacks (Bolo Breath) and return them to him. Speaking of a negative reception, I think that moment also got quite a fair share of it when it happened a year and a half ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Release-Date-Time.jpg><p>I think like around the late 1990s Everyone had their own take on it and how it broke the power scale or whatever. But it ultimately wound up meaning nothing because Kaidou just destroyed all of them and didn’t even have to go hybrid. It was just a nice moment for Raizo to have, you know because the scabbards got all of their own individual moments before ultimately getting destroyed something similar he did when he was in Zuo he kept in his scrolls the water that Zunesha used to bath.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1046_Spoilers_-_What_Happened_to_Zoro></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Spoilers – What Happened to Zoro?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Raizo had this idea in mind ever since the Oden Castle burned down 20 years ago so that if he were ever in a similar situation again, he would be prepared the water in his scroll has flooded the interior of the castle and Gin Bay is the one who controls the water as he was a sea current to put out the fire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Twitter-Reddit.jpg><p>Alright, that’s actually pretty cool, although still a little problematic with Raizo because he seemingly has hundreds of gallons, if not 1000s of gallons of water in his scrolls somehow. The minutiae of the Ninjitsu in one piece, I guess ultimately doesn’t really matter, because it only really pertains to Raizo and like eight other characters. But speaking of the other characters Fukurokuju was also a ninja. And before this Raizo was fighting against him for like, I don’t know, 20 chapters or something where they were kind of just in this stalemate of ninjitsu lock and seeing who would succumb to the fire in the castle first and of course.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1046_Recap_Ending_Explain></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Recap [Ending Explain]</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It was Fukurokuju who gave in first and Raizo’s persevere, but I don’t know if that was like Fukurokuju dying because I’m pretty sure there still needs to be a big reveal with them. Like he’s a part of the Third Eye Tribe. He has like this divot in his forehead and he also wears like sunglasses, so I’m assuming that he needs to reveal that but also he has like ear lobes like and now and I’m assuming that Enel is also part of the third eye because that’s why he’s always wearing the do-rag thing that he has.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Spoilers-Leaked-Online-Details.jpg><p>But that’s a story for another time and might not even come true but it’s you know, an interesting little theory, but I really liked the way that he’s synergizing with Gin Bay here. Gin Bay is one of my favorites and just seeing him do more stuff is always nice, especially like when he’s getting this fire out of the way because it’s been like this persistent ticking clock for like six months now. The first page is the cover no details about it yet. The first five pages of the chapter are from Luffy versus Kaidou. The next nine pages are inside of the castle everything about Raizo, Gin Bay, Sanji, and Zoro.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1046_Spoilers_Leaked_on_Reddit_Twitter></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Spoilers Leaked on Reddit & Twitter</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Spoilers-Leaked-Online.jpg><p>Sanji and Zoro appear in one panel each Sanji appears talking and Zoro is carried away by Frankie. He doesn’t say anything or is still unconscious. Okay, so we’re getting a mild update on Zoro here. So after his fight with King, he was visited by this Reaper individual. And we all have tons of theories on what this could be, of course, it hasn’t been revealed yet could be the soul of Enma or something visiting him or whatever. There’s a lot of like Soul stuff going on in one piece. And it becomes more and more evident as the series goes on.</p><p>And I guess it also ties back to what the call Buurman is no the thing that like fixed up the Sunni and I have no doubts that Odo will make everything come full circle and he’ll be like, Oh, well the club human is actually this and it ties to this and this is why devil fruits also have a mind of their own. I’m sure it’s all connected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Spoilers-Leaked.jpg><p>But what I’m trying to say is that the Reaper is probably tied to all of that stuff. And maybe it is coming from Enma or the hockey within it or it could be something to do with the drug that chopper gave him maybe I don’t know like I said we all have our own theories and I’m sure everybody already knows and made up their mind in the comments anyway, but it also appears that that rebirthing made some kind of tangible slice on Zoro because, in the panel that we see him after that sequence, it looks like he had like a new cut on him or something but I’m glad that Frankie is at least getting him here. No, I never thought Zoro was going to die. Obviously, he’s not he meant what he said actually He had lost to Mihawk that will come to fruition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1046_Release_Date_Time_Schedule_Details></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Release Date, Time (Schedule Details)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=3.2417061611374><tr readability=2><td><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Release Date</strong></td><td>10th April 2022</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Release Timing<br></strong></td><td>8.00 EST</td></tr><tr readability=1.4871794871795><td><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Reddit</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Click Here</a></td></tr><tr readability=1.5><td><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Twitter</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Click Here</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Homepage</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Click Here</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wikipedia</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Click Here</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1046_Spoilers_Leaked_Online></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Spoilers Leaked Online</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There’s one page about Yamato and Momonosuke. And something about the clouds of flames at the end of the chapter Kaidou’s clouds that lift Onega Shima have begun to fade Yamato Momonosuke starts to notice that the islands started to is about to fall. Okay, so finally this is coming into play. I was wondering when this is going to happen because while we’ve been having a good time watching Luffy you know, smack around and cloud him up. Kaido has been literally holding Onega Shima up with his fruit ability or one of his many fruit abilities and I’m sure that is a factor in him not being able to go 100% or whatever against Luffy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Spoilers-Reddit.jpg><p>I was wondering like okay, so how much does Luffy have to beat him down for this to just not work anymore? And we all knew that this was eventually going to be a thing of course and we just assumed Oh, I guess Momonosuke is gonna be the one to keep it afloat because you know, of course, he has Kaiduo’s cloud lifting ability thing if he does keep Onega Shima float and especially stops it from crashing into the flower capital then that will be like his big moment, especially if everybody sees it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1046_Spoilers_on_Twitter_Reddit></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1046 Spoilers on Twitter & Reddit</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Spoilers-Twitter.jpg><p>They give me like, oh, Momonosuke, save the song. We accept him as the new Shogun but also another thing that we speculated about before Momonosuke started doing the whole cloud thing was that Luffy was going to of course a weakness for which he had and then he was just going to change all of owning a Shima into like rubber so that instead of it crashing, it would just bounce like a massive ball or something and that would be amazing as well but it kind of takes away Momonosuke’s moment, you know what I mean? Or maybe they can share the moment like it’s falling then temporarily Luffy makes it rubber and pounces up and then Momonosuke catches it with his clouds or so so we can have our cake and eat it or they can as well and the final page where Luffy catches lightning.</p><p>Related:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece Chapter 1045 Spoilers: Leaked Reddit, Twitter Release Date</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=About_One_Piece_Manga_Series></span><strong>About One Piece Manga Series</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/One-Piece-Chapter-1046-Spoilers.jpg><p>He looks like a god of thunder and goes to attack Kaido and Kaido seems to laugh and say go ahead for something. Luffy’s final attack has no name. And there’s a break next week. This really goes back to the fights however, he wants exposition on Luffy’s fruit catching the lightning and then I guess ease attacking Kaido with it. That’s pretty incredible.</p><p>And it makes sense of course because you know Luffy being the rubber or resin or latex or whatever he truly is we’ve seen that he was immune to announce fruit so I guess he would be able to grab lightning and really have no effect on but him being able to like manipulate it and use it.</p><p>That’s a whole other story. Still pretty cool though. Now Kaido saying Go ahead either means that like he’s welcoming his defeat here or he’s like, go ahead because Shima is going to fall and you’re going to lose, or something like that.</p><p>Thanks for reading this Article on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">News Unzip</a>.
