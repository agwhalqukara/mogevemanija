After receiving a Chair at the brutal Six Chair Challenge with their phenomenal rendition of&nbsp;Beyoncé’s ‘I Was Here’, the talented girl band are through to the next round of the competition: Judges’ Houses, whereby they will compete for a place in the Live Shows.</p><p>Here at CelebMix, we had the opportunity to talk to Lemonade about what we can expect from them at Judges’ Houses, their musical influences – and more! Check out our exclusive interview below.</p><p><strong>We absolutely loved your performance at Bootcamp. Was Bootcamp as brutal and intense as it is portrayed on ‘The X Factor’?</strong></p><p>Lemonade:&nbsp;‘Nothing could have prepared us for how brutal that part of the competition was but it made us stronger and we got closer as a band going through it.’</p><p></p><p><strong>How did you prepare to go on stage at Bootcamp? Were you nervous, excited, or experiencing a range of emotions?</strong></p><p>Lemonade: ‘We prayed to our little angel charm as we do before every performance and although we were very excited to get out there, we stayed remarkably calm.’</p><p><strong>Your mentor Simon Cowell asked you to have a sing-off with JBK. Were you nervous being asked to sing against them?</strong></p><p>Lemonade: ‘Going up against any of the Groups would have been just as scary as they are all amazing.’</p><p></p><p><strong>Who do you feel is your biggest rival within the competition?</strong></p><p>Lemonade: ‘Rak-Su.’</p><p><strong>Knowing that Simon has worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry today, what has he been like as a mentor?</strong></p><p>Lemonade:&nbsp;‘Simon is very caring about us as people and as artists. He is extremely positive and always seems to look to the future and help guide us towards success. We love him!!’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did you feel whenever you found out that Simon was going to be your mentor on the show?</strong></p><p>Lemonade: ‘Ecstatic is the only word to describe the way we felt.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If Simon wasn’t your mentor, is there any Judge, in particular, you would have liked to have?</strong></p><p>Lemonade:&nbsp;‘Nicole, as she knows what it is like to be in a girl band.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></p><p>Lemonade:&nbsp;‘Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey,&nbsp;Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Etta James and Tina Turner.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you provide us with a preview of what can be expected from your performance at Judges’ Houses this weekend?</strong></p><p>Lemonade: ‘Watch and see!’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have a message for your supporters?</strong></p><p>Lemonade: ‘They are the only reason we are able to follow our dreams. We just want to say thank you for the incredible support we are getting. It is beyond amazing.’&nbsp;</p><p>If you aren’t already, make sure you are following Lemonade on&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>Are you as excited as we are to see Lemonade’s performance on ‘The X Factor’ over the weekend?
