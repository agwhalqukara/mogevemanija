How does the star maintain her incredibly fit figure? Read on for 8 ways Addison Rae stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Addison-Rae-1.png><p><span>Addison takes her workouts just as seriously as her career. The star sweats at The Dogpound, where she does rigorous, HIIT style workouts. The gym recently shared a clip from one of her workouts, where she does battle ropes, cable glute kickbacks, jumping jack slams and ankle weight kickbacks like a pro.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Addison loves working out with her friends. She is often photographed hitting classes with pal Hailey Bieber and also enlists her pal and He's All That co-star Kourtney Kardashian, as a workout buddy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Addison does a lot of glute work. "I've done this butt workout so many times because it literally burns so bad but it's so good," she explained to Kourtney during a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>virtual</span></a><span> workout video the two filmed during the pandemic. In it, she does donkey kicks, fire hydrants and fire hydrant extensions on each leg for two circuits.</span></p><p><span>Addison is all about staying active. Skateboarding, surfing, kayaking, kickboxing, and hiking are just a few of the other ways she stays fit. "Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn," explains the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>. "Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1357799342-1.jpg><p><span>Obviously, dancing is a big part of Addision's life. And, lucky for her, it is a great aerobic activity. "The guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. But even small amounts of physical activity are helpful. Being active for short periods of time throughout the day can add up to provide health benefits," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1356217621.jpg><p><span>Addison is a regular at her local pilates studio and has been spotted leaving the low impact exercise classes more than once. "A Pilates class will strengthen your core muscles–abdominal and spinal. This will improve your balance and coordination, as well as your posture. Having a strong core improves every move you make because all movements start from the body's core.&nbsp; Pilates classes can help to relieve back pain and prevent injury. Exercises are performed laying on your back, your stomach, your side and also seated," explains the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/shutterstock_1439885849.jpg><p><span>Addison makes hydration a priority​​. "I have a list of things like drinking a gallon of water a day," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>StyleCaster</span></a><span>. "It's really hard." Like Kourt's sister Khloe, she is a fan of Amazon's under $20 Fidus water bottle, which holds a gallon of water and shows you how much you need to drink. "It has motivational sayings to keep you on track," she said about the bottle, which she discovered on TikTok. "A lot of fitness stuff I've gotten is from TikTok," she noted.</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1351424116-1.jpg><p><span>Addison tries to slip in mini workouts daily. "I've been trying to workout every day for at least 15 minutes. That doesn't entail a crazy workout every day, but it's 15 minutes of some type of exercise like walking or running or stretching, yoga, things like that. I feel like you never see results until you start and that's what's been motivating me. Exercise helps you so much more than just externally. It opens your mind," she told StyleCaster.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkmpyUnsCwuoyrmJ5lmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKygqatdmb%2BquspmoKdlpJ2ybr%2FAp5to</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elijah-millar-missing-help-find-missing-elijah-millar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elijah Millar Missing, Help Find Missing Elijah Millar</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./terry-tolkin-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Terry Tolkin Cause of Death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fact-check-is-kristie-mewis-lesbian-meet-her-partner-sam-kerr.html>Fact Check: Is Kristie Mewis Lesbian?
