Now, her co-star, Kandi Burruss, shares the real reason why she thinks NeNe did that!</p><p>According to Kandi, NeNe was most likely trying to avoid someone during the taping even though she usually goes all in when it comes to her feuds.</p><p>The latest RHOA reunion happened virtually, every Housewife filming from the safety of their homes due to the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>That being said, NeNe was able to bail on the reunion very easily, just by clicking a few things on her computer!</p><p>While she participated in it the first two parts of the reunion taping, during part three, she was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Coincidently, or not, that is also when her ex-pal, Yovanna Momplaisir showed up to talk about the whole ‘snakegate’ recording scandal.</p><p>During an interview for HollywoodLife, Kandi Burruss shared her opinion on why NeNe disappeared during that segment, saying that: ‘She definitely left because of Yovanna. Let’s be clear — regardless of how me and her argue or she argues with anybody else. She definitely can handle herself in an argument, let’s be clear. She had already told the world she was planning on reading us that day, so it wasn’t because she was arguing with us. As a matter of fact in the moment that she got up to walk away, we weren’t even talking to her anymore.’</p><p>‘So it wasn’t like anything that happened in that moment to make her get up and walk away. What had happened was that Yovanna had posted a video on social media to kind of let people know that she was about to come on. And NeNe was told by whoever was on her team, or whatever or she saw or whatever, and that’s what made her get up and walk away. She didn’t want to deal with her,’ the reality TV star went on to tell the news outlet.</p><p>Kandi also argued that she could not explain why NeNe did not want to deal with her since she isn’t NeNe and could not truly know that.</p><p>All that’s clear is that she just walked away when her former friend appeared so she definitely did not want to have a back and forth with her at the time.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Kandi admitted that everyone was upset about it since there were many other things to discuss.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblrultYybrKuqpajAbr%2FHmqmeq12ptaZ50Z6YrKeeYsSpxYynnKedXaGyorfErGSbmZmhsqV5zqdkraCVYsOqvtOumKVloprCr7XOp2RtaGBtgXN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-ari-parker-bio-age-husband-kids-net-worth-parents-movies-tv-shows.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole Ari Parker Bio, Age,Husband, Kids, Net Worth, Parents, Movies, TV Shows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jose-manalo-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jose Manalo Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fact-check-is-kristie-mewis-lesbian-meet-her-partner-sam-kerr.html>Fact Check: Is Kristie Mewis Lesbian?
