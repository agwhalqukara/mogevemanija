In particular, she doesn't want to promote diets to them. "In our house, we don't talk about body hang-ups or diets," she says to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Closer</span></a><span>. "Nelly sometimes sees me eating something healthy and asks, 'Mummy, are you on that diet?', so I know she just thinks a diet is a type of food! I'd never say, 'I look fat' in front of the kids. My mum was never like that with us. We would never obsess over putting on a pound – that is the opposite of what we are like in our house."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1242050329.jpg><p><span>Shepherd tells Closer that she wants to teach her children healthy habits. She says that she will remind them of certain things each day. "I'm more about teaching them the importance of being healthy. So it's more, 'You have to brush your teeth after this', or, 'You've eaten a lot of sweets today' – it's about their health over anything to do with weight."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1408493737.jpg><p><span>Shepherd shared some of her wellness tips in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hello!</span></a><span> She says that she has cut back on drinking alcohol, as it has too many empty calories. "Before I had children I was out eating all the time, drinking alcohol," she says. "Don't get me wrong, I love a prosecco or a white wine. I'll still have a few drinks, but nothing like what I used to. Back in the day you'd be out three times a week and now it's once a month if you're lucky."</span></p><p><span>Shepherd likes to do at home workouts. "I've never been one of those people who likes to go to the gym", she said to Hello! "But there are always bits I want to tone like my belly, arms and legs, so I do regular squats around the house and sit-ups. I also run up and down my stairs about 200 times a day for Nelly, I just think I've been lucky because I stay really active with her."</span></p><p><span>After having her first child, Shepherd opened up about her post-baby weight loss in an interview with the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Daily Star</span></a><span>. She says that when it comes to her diet, she believes in a balanced approach. "I wouldn't say I particularly watch what I eat," she says. "I'm lucky that I like relatively healthy food – I eat a lot of chicken, vegetables and salad. But, if there's something that I want, I won't deprive myself of having it. My treats are tea and biscuits."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkm6GcobamedKhnKmglaexbrXNZpmarJieu6h50q6grWWcpLysv4yloKSdXamus8bAp2SappRit6K6xGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brit-hume-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brit Hume Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yael-bernal-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yael Bernal Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fact-check-is-kristie-mewis-lesbian-meet-her-partner-sam-kerr.html>Fact Check: Is Kristie Mewis Lesbian?
