However, he lost to Crew Mclyntre in the match.</span></p><p><span>Madcap survived a nasty bump right on his head when Drew performed Alabama Slam on him. Drew simply leaned forward for the slam, and Moss should have landed flat on his stomach with his arms out, but Moss kept his head tucked like he was trying to roll through it, but instead, he landed right directly on his head, causing many people to worry about his head.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After the performance, he was checked out backstage, and it was confirmed that he didn't suffer any injury in the process. The video clearly showed how hard he landed on his head, so it should be considered as a miracle that he has avoided any injury on the Nasty Slam in WWE Elimination Chamber.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Madcap Moss WWE Contract, Career, & Salary</span></strong></h2><p><span>Madcap Moss was <a href=# rel=noopener>signed to WWE</a> in 2014 after he attended a WWE tryout after contacting Jim Ross.
