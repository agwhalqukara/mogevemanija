How rich Michael Kay is? According to sources, Michael Kay’s overall net worth, as of early 2016, is estimated at $3 million, which has been acquired through his broadcasting career that has been active since 1982.</p><h3>Michael Kay Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>This native New Yorker, nephew of famous actor <a href=#>Danny Aiello</a>, started reporting while still a teenager, at the Bronx High School of Science. Michael continued his education at Fordham University from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications. Shortly after graduation, in 1982 Michael’s career officially began when he started working at SportsPhone and also as a public announcer for the New York Pro Summer Basketball League. These accomplishments provided the basis for his net worth.</p><p>Later that year, Michael Kay got the job of general assignment writer for the New York Post, covering college basketball. His television debut came soon after, when he started covering the New Jersey Nets. In 1987, Michael Kay switched to baseball and started serving as the New York Yankees broadcaster which he remains to this day. This wasn’t only Michael’s biggest professional task so far, but also the main source of his net worth.</p><p>Between 1989 and 1992, Michael Kay worked at the New York Daily News, before moving to WABC Radio. This transfer made Michael the first newspaper reporter in any sport who became a full-time broadcaster performing play-by-play as well as analysis. Michael stayed on the radio for 10 years, and in 2002 he moved to debuting on the YES Network, where he became the Yankee’s lead television play-by-play announcer. These engagements have certainly increased Michael’s overall net worth.</p><p>In 2002, Michael Kay started hosting his own radio show, a 4-hour sports talk show – The Michael Kay Show – airing on the WEPN-FM in New York City. Apart from this, he is currently hosting Centerstage on the Yes Network. During his dynamic sports reporter career, Michael Kay also served as play-by-play commentator during the 2008 National League Division Series and 2013 American League Division Series.</p><p>For his hard work, dedication and contribution to sport journalism, Michael Kay has won numerous rewards, including Dick Young Award for Excellence in Sports Media by the New York Pro Baseball Scouts, New York Emmy for Outstanding Live Sports Coverage, and New York Emmys for Outstanding Live Sports Coverage – Single Program.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Michael Kay has been married to Jodi Applegate, broadcast journalist, since 2011, with whom he has a daughter and a son.</p><p>Michael Kay is notably involved within the Alzheimer’s Association, and he also, alongside Yankee’s manager <a href=#>Joe Girardi</a> and Girardi’s Catch 25 Foundation, organizes annual charity dinners in order to raise money for Alzheimer’s research.</p><p>He is very active and popular on social networks – over 150,000 people regularly follow his tweets. Michael Kay’s official Facebook page currently has more than a million ‘likes’.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.3719851576994><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Michael Kay</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 2, 1961</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City USA</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>Television play-by-play broadcaster, radio talk show host</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Bronx High School of Science, Fordham University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Jodi Applegate Kay (m. 2011)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Charles Applegate Kay, Caledonia Rose Kay,</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Rose Kay</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Debbie Kay</td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/realmichaelkay</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1701985</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Dick Young Award for Excellence in Sports Media, New York Emmy for Outstanding Live Sports Coverage</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Writer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=writer readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>CenterStage</td><td></td><td>TV Series documentary 2 episodes, 2005 - 2006 writer - 8 episodes, 2005 - 2006</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Henry & Me</td><td>2014</td><td></td><td>Himself (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>CenterStage</td><td>2005-2011</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself - Host</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Late Show with David Letterman</td><td>2010-2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - At Yankees Spring Training / Himself - YES Network Announcer</td></tr><tr><td>Closers</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself - Host</td></tr><tr><td>Yankeeography</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Great 8s</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself - Host</td></tr><tr><td>Captain's Corner</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself - Host</td></tr><tr><td>YESterdays</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Host</td></tr><tr><td>ESPN SportsCentury</td><td>2003</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqagnKCRmrlut8CyZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./weetzie-bat-season-1-release-date-plot-and-all-you-need-to-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Weetzie Bat Season 1: Release Date, Plot And All You Need To Know!!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-chloe-symonds-on-instagram-andrew-symonds-daughter-is-beautiful-as-she-mourns-the-passing-of-h.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Chloe Symonds On Instagram, Andrew Symonds Daughter Is Beautiful As She Mourns The Passing Of H</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fact-check-is-kristie-mewis-lesbian-meet-her-partner-sam-kerr.html>Fact Check: Is Kristie Mewis Lesbian?
