At the time, Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, and rumors of infidelity swirled around his budding relationship with Angelina.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_eq6yjtMiL data-wc=41>Brad and Jennifer's divorce announcement sparked a media frenzy, with both stars denying that infidelity played a role in their split. Nevertheless, Brad and Angelina's relationship became the talk of the nation, and their on-screen chemistry seemed to fuel the rumors.</p><p id=en8iptHOJGL data-wc=58>In a 2008 interview, Angelina admitted that they had fallen for each other during the filming of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. She described it as a "strange friendship and partnership" that gradually evolved into something more meaningful.

Angelina, on the other hand, argued that no such agreement existed and accused Brad of trying to silence her about the alleged abuse.</p><p id=emzvIKClvof3 data-wc=38>Furthermore, Angelina's investment company, Nouvel, filed a $350 million lawsuit against Brad, accusing him of misusing the company's assets for personal gain.
