Parker started to receive rave reviews early in her career, while she still performed on Broadway, earning appraisals for both Prelude to a Kiss (1990-91) and a Tony Award for Proof (2000-03). She made her big screen breakthrough in 1991's Fried Green Tomatoes, which was followed by another remarkable performance of hers, this time in 1995's Boys on the Side. As for TV, she made a mark with her portrayal of Harper Pitt in Angels in America (2003), as well as her recurring role as Amy Gardner on The West Wing (2001-06).

But contrary to the happenings in her personal life, Parker's career since skyrocketed. In 2005, she joined the cast of Weeds as a leading lady of the show, while still making stage and movie appearances in major projects like The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007, opposite Brad Pitt) and The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmedlr%2B6ecuorKKrlWK9or7KnqlmppWperi70a2fZmpna39ygw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-mahomes-father-arrested-a-week-before-super-bowl-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Mahomes father arrested a week before Super Bowl 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dulce-mar%C3%ADa-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Dulce Mara Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fact-check-is-kristie-mewis-lesbian-meet-her-partner-sam-kerr.html>Fact Check: Is Kristie Mewis Lesbian?
