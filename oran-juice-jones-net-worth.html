Juice was active in the entertainment industry from 1986 to 1997.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Oran “Juice” Jones? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $2 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2017. Music is the main source of Juice’s popularity and modest fortune.</p><h3>Oran “Juice” Jones Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the boy grew up in Harlem, New York, but little slese is known about his childhood and schooling.</p><p>Concerning his professional career, he began by signing a contract with a subsidiary of Def Jam entitled OBR Records, one of the first R&B musicians to do so. Juice became known for the song “The Rain” (1986), which topped the Billboard R&amp;B; <a href=#>Russell Simmons</a> and Vincent Bell were responsible for the production of the aforementioned single, and it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and in addition, the song was nominated in two categories for Grammy Awards. The single has also promoted the album “Juice” (1986) which could not repeat the success of the above mentioned single, as it reached only 4th place on the Billboard R&B albums chart, and 44th on the Billboard 200. Other singles listed in the above mentioned album were “Curiosity” and “You Can’t Hide from Love”, both of which appeared in the Billboard R&B top 100. Overall, “Juice” was the most successful album released by Oran Jones, so boosting his net worth.</p><p>In 1987, he released his second studio album “GTO: Gangsters Takin’ Over”, which reached 36th position on Billboard R&B albums, with the most successful single from the second album being “Cold Spending My Money” (1987) which was listed 41st on the Billboard R&B chart. In 1989, the third studio album “To Be Immortal” showed up, but was a commercial failure, and only the single “Pipe Dreams” appeared on the Billboard R&B top 100. In 1997, the comeback album “Player’s Call” was released, produced by Willie Mitchell, although it did not help, as it was commercial flop again. None of the singles, nor the album appeared on music charts.</p><p>However, Oran Jones added sums to the outright size of his net worth appearing in several films. In 1987 he was seen in the crime drama film “Less Than Zero” (1987) directed by Marek Kanievska, and in 1992 he appeared in the biographical film “Malcolm X” by <a href=#>Spike Lee</a>. The same year, he starred in the action drama film “Juice” written and directed by Ernest R. Dickerson.</p><p>To conclude, all of the above mentioned engagements have added sums to the total size of Oran “Juice” Jones net worth.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the former R&B singer, has been married for nearly 30 years, and reputedly has seven children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.711428571429><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 28, 1957</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Houston, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, R&B singer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>United States Naval Academy</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Perri Jones, Oran II</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/oranjuicejones7</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28571428571429><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/oranjuicejones?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0428961</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23188405797101><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/oran-juice-jones-mn0000403839</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Record Labels</td><td>Tommy Boy Entertainment, Def Jam Recordings</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Albums</td><td>Juice (1986), To Be Immortal (1989), GTO: Gangsters Takin' Over (1987), Player's Call (1997)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award - Best R&B Vocal Performance (1986, The Rain)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>New Jersey Drive (1995), Malcolm X (1992), Less Than Zero (1987), Waters Rising (2007)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>TV Shows</td><td>Jim Carrey/Bellamy Young/Oran "Juice" Jones (2014, Comedy, Music, Talk-Show), Jimmy Kimmel Live!
