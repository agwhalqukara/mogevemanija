She wasn't famous before the commercials so she likely had to work for a standard day rate which at the time wouldn't have been more than $5,000 or $10,000. On the flip side, as the star of a national commercial that aired many thousands of times, she earned a royalty every time the commercial aired. She likely earned several hundred thousand dollars, potentially as much as $1 million during her time with Pepsi alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLWiuMuinGadmaiyr67Eq55mppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-pete-davidson-hosting-a-new-saturday-night-live-this-week.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Pete Davidson Hosting a New 'Saturday Night Live' This Week?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./letterkenny-5-things-to-know-about-the-comedy-show-on-hulu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>'Letterkenny': 5 things to know about the comedy show on Hulu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fact-check-is-kristie-mewis-lesbian-meet-her-partner-sam-kerr.html>Fact Check: Is Kristie Mewis Lesbian?
