His style incorporates elements of dancehall, bashment, and rap and draws influence from the British Caribbean community in West London.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Face considers him one of the pioneers of the UK drill scene, and GQ has called him “the most influential British rapper of our time.”</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happened To Digga D Eye?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2017, he and his group 1011 were arrested and given a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) in 2018.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The CBO required the group to have the Metropolitan Police’s permission before releasing any new music, forbade them from using London postcodes, and banned references to real-life incidents and people in lyrics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite these restrictions, Digga was recalled to prison in 2019 for breaching the conditions of his CBO. He was also stabbed in the eye with a blade fashioned from a tuna can, causing him to lose the use of the eye.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Digga D’s lawyer, Cecilia Goodwin, said the rapper struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-991.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In March 2020, Digga pleaded guilty to violent disorder and breaches of his CBO and was sentenced to two years and six months for his role in a machete brawl in front of shoppers in West London with rival gang members.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Digga was arrested again in July 2020 for inciting violence after attending a Black Lives Matter protest in London and posting about the movement on Instagram.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has since been released but is still under the conditions of his CBO. In November 2021, social media rumors claimed he was arrested for stabbing a man in Dubai. Still, Digga denied the allegations and said he was released soon after his arrest.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Why Was He Arrested?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Digga D is a prominent figure in Britain’s drill scene, a subgenre of hip-hop that portrays life in some of the country’s most deprived neighborhoods.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Digga D, a UK rapper, has been arrested multiple times for various charges. His sometimes-violent lyrics have drawn criticism from the Police and lawmakers who accuse the genre of fueling knife crime.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Like many of his peers, Digga D has found himself on the wrong side of the law, and his lyrics reflect his experiences of gang life, criminal justice, and time behind bars.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2018, Digga D was sentenced to 21 months for conspiracy to commit violent disorder. Upon his release in May 2020, he was given a court order banning him from rapping about violence.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The order was part of a criminal behavior order introduced in 2014, which gives judges broad powers to regulate a convicted criminal’s life, including the ability to control their lyrics.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-992.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The judge argued that Digga D’s lyrics, which often featured references to violence, could stoke street tensions and lead to further criminal activity. Since the ban was imposed, Digga D has been careful not to violate the order.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has continued to make music but has focused on other topics, such as his experiences with mental health and the effects of the criminal justice system on young black men.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite the restrictions on his music, Digga D remains a popular figure in the drill scene, and his music resonates with many young people in Britain’s inner cities.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While some argue that drill music glorifies violence and fuels criminal activity, others see it as a reflection of the harsh realities of life in Britain’s inner cities.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how authorities will balance the need to protect public safety with the right to artistic expression.</span></p><p><strong>You May Also Like: </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Malcolm X Autopsy Photos: Who Killed Him?
