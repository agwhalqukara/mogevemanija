She began her career as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color, and in 1997, she landed the lead part in the Selena biopic, which catapulted her to fame. She has eight studio albums under her belt and has served as a judge on American Idol in the past. She was the first woman to win the Billboard Icon Award in 2014.</p><p>Actor, screenwriter, director, producer, and philanthropist<a href=# rel=noopener> Ben Affleck</a> has a variety of talents. He gained notoriety for his ground-breaking performance in the 1997 movie Good Will Hunting, which he co-wrote with actor and longtime friend Matt Damon. He is the founder of Eastern Congo Initiative (ECI), an advocacy group that works with the people of eastern Congo, and he has won two Oscars and three Golden Globes.</p><p>The actors <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> and <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> married last month, and since then, they have been photographed vacationing in Europe. However, a recent Hollywood <a href=#>Life story</a> has raised some questions about their position. Look into what transpired.</p><p></p><p>The most popular <a href=#>couple</a> in Hollywood at the moment is Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Three weeks ago, the couple wed in a private ceremony in Las Vegas. 18 years after calling off their initial engagement in 2004, the actors wed. However, a recent Hollywood Life piece raised some questions regarding their position.</p><p>Lopez and Affleck, who the media has dubbed Bennifer, have been photographed in Europe recently while on their honeymoon with their respective children, and social media has been inundated with memes depicting Affleck dozing off while on a sightseeing cruise on the Seine River in Paris.</p><p>They first got back together in May 2021, after Lopez called off her engagement to Alex Rodriguez and Affleck terminated his relationship with Ana de Armas. The two had first met on the set of “Gigli” in 2002. Why are there whispers of a possible breakup after shocking the world with the announcement of “the best wedding” they could have imagined?</p><p><a href=#>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez</a> will spend some time apart.</p><p></p><p>Affleck, age 49, and Lopez, age 53, will split up for a spell after their honeymoon because of their demanding work commitments, according to Hollywood Life. The Batman actor will stay in Europe while traveling back to Los Angeles, claims a source close to the couple. However, they won’t have a problem with it.</p><p>They “definitely know better than anyone else the demands that come with doing what they do,” the source told the magazine, “which is the one thing that makes their relationship so special.” They genuinely believe that being apart strengthens them, which is perfect because they can make a tonne of money when they are apart. Both parties gain from this.</p><p>They constantly communicate with one another, and the report claims that their time apart makes their reunion all the more satisfying. The source continued, “JLo enjoys the fact that she knows her spouse will always be there for her.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQNv_5vJokk</p><p>Bennifer is therefore doing fine. According to rumors, Affleck will reprise his role as Batman in the next DC films <strong>“Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom”</strong> and <a href=#><strong>“The Flash.”</strong></a> In addition, he will co-write, direct, and appear in a movie about a sports marketing executive who courted basketball icon Michael Jordan in the middle of the 1980s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6y1unnDoptmopWju6qyxKtkpaegmsdurc2dZJudnmKup7LLnpqkZZKnsqK3jK6nZpmWqbKzeZJmrp6dm6h6sLKMppirqpmWtKZ5wKWjZrGfqnqvscSdZK2nXaC7sMOO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./janet-jackson-justin-timberlake-s-super-bowl-scandal-a-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlakes Super Bowl Scandal: A Timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-odele-ventimiglia-wiki-biography-husband-parents-death-age-net-worth-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who was Odele Ventimiglia?
