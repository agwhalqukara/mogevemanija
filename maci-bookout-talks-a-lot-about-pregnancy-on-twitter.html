It’s sad, honest and true; she was once a popular girl in high school. She had good grades, she was well-liked and she was on her way to becoming a great athlete. That all changed when she became pregnant with her high school boyfriend, to whom she became engaged. Raising a son and going to high school and college was not easy for her, so she dropped out of college. She and her boyfriend broke up and she was in and out of relationships for the next few years. She recently announced that she and her current boyfriend are expecting a baby together later this year. The news comes as a shock to her fans considering the fact that she suffers from a health condition that makes becoming pregnant difficult. She’s having a little girl and has referred to her as her miracle baby.</p><p>While it appears that she is getting her life in order, we can honestly say that we wouldn’t want the same for our own daughters, and the reality star would probably agree. She said she signed up to become one of the stars of the reality show 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom because she wanted other girls her age to see the struggles of being a teenage mother.<a href=#> Maci Bookout</a> has a Twitter page that shows just how she’s doing now that she’s pregnant with her second child, and it’s a nice change from the pregnancy she had at 16.</p><p>Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGikmpuZYq%2Bwu8qorK1lpJa5rL%2BMpaatZaCnsqi6wKeasmWkrLa1wMSrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mrjww-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>MrJWW Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-ty-pennington-married-about-the-hgtv-star-s-love-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Ty Pennington Married?
